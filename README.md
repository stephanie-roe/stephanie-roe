### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steph *(she/her)*- a retail and hospitality leader turned Front-End Engineer. 

ðŸŒ± Throughout 2022, I've has the opportunity to collaborate alongside brilliant minds and career-changers like myself at the Turing School of Software and Design, gaining proficiency in `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `React`. 

ðŸ’» I've developed and tested several applications using unit testing frameworks like `Mocha` and `Chai` and have thoroughly implemented E2E testing with `Cypress`. Beyond the technical skills that have served me well throughout each project, my systematic problem solving process enables me to visualize and implement creative solutions. 

ðŸ§¶ I've most recently finished working on **Craft Circle**, a no-cost marketplace where users can connect to arrange the borrow and trade of supplies in an effort to create more equity within creative spaces. 

ðŸ“’ In a 14 day sprint, I collaborated on a cross-functional team to conceptualize our product, self-teach and implement `Graph QL` and incorportate continuous integration with `Circle CI`. Clear commuinication and an organzied, agile workflow allowed my group to succeed, carrying our application to compete alongside others before a panel of respected judges within the tech industry.
