### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Stephanie *(she/her)*- a software engineer with previous experience in hospitality and customer service. 

ðŸŒ± Throughout 2022, I had the opportunity to collaborate alongside brilliant minds and career-changers like myself at the Turing School of Software and Design, gaining proficiency in `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `React`. 

ðŸ’» I've developed and tested several applications using unit testing frameworks like `Mocha` and `Chai` and have thoroughly implemented E2E testing with `Cypress`. Beyond the technical skills that have served me well throughout each project, my systematic problem solving process enables me to visualize and implement creative solutions. 

ðŸ§¶ To complete my transition into tech, I built **Craft Circle**, a no-cost marketplace where users can connect to arrange the borrow and trade of supplies in an effort to create more equity within creative spaces. 

ðŸ“’ In a 14 day sprint, I collaborated on a cross-functional team to conceptualize a product, self-teach and implement `Graph QL` and incorportate continuous integration with `Circle CI`. Clear commuinication and an organzied, agile workflow allowed my group to succeed, carrying our application to compete alongside others before a panel of respected judges within the tech industry. 

ðŸ©º In September of 2022, I joined **CVS Health**, fulfilling the role of **Site Reliability Engineer**. Throughout my development as a part of the Aetna Health Digital team, I've gained understanding of an enterprise-scale codebase and collaborated across the organization to navigate incidents and quickly resolve defects, ensuring members maintain user-friendly access to their healthcare. 

ðŸ‘¾ I'm currently working towards an `AWS Cloud Practicioner` certificate, am building my familiarity with `New Relic` and have supported in the refinement of documentation for my team in an effort to provide lasting contributions for the growth and advancement of the organization's evolving SRE practice.
